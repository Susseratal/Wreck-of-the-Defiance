# The Wreck of the Defiance  
This is a little idea mainly about making a game for obselete hardware because I thought it was funny. It's loosely based on the 1980 board game "Wreck of the BSM Pandora", in as much as I read the basic premise of the game and got distracted.  

## Premise:  
You play as a spaceship captain travelling the galaxy, salvaging ships and trading in goods. The game is designed to be a sort of "Elite Light" using an FTL style map screen rather than a fully explorable universe.
