# The Wreck of the Defiance  
This is a little idea mainly about making a game for obselete hardware because I thought it was funny. It's loosely based on the 1980 board game "Wreck of the BSM Pandora", in as much as I read the basic premise of the game and got distracted.  

## Premise:  
What if I made it like Elite though?  
A team of researchers crashes on an alien planet, and the player has to instruct the few surviving scientists to perform system repairs while hostile aliens attempt to get aboard. The game will focus on preparation and strategy as each turn the player will have to predict and account for what the aliens will do next, while trying to get as much done as possible.
